## Data Collection
The data used for this project was sourced from Kaggle.com on Europe Sales Record from 2010 – 2017. The dataset consists of 1 unique value and 14 columns. The project was to work on tracking the KPIs, Visualize the countries and the monthly sales.

## Data Cleaning
* Tools
  - Excel
    
The dataset was cleaned by checking for errors, duplicates and null values by using the sort and filter option and we realized there was none in the dataset. The format for the columns; Total Profit, Total Revenue, Total Cost, Unit Cost and Unit Price were changed to currency. While Unit Sold was changed to number format. The Order Date and Ship Date were changed to Short date format. Then finally we added a design to our dataset to make it presentable.

1. Total Profit by Order Priority: Pie Chart, we realized that “M” had the highest profit of $136m, followed by “H“ with 128m.
